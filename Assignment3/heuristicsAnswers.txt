The heurstics for the water jugs didn't really help, in comparison to the 
dfs it only searched 9, while in the heurstic it searched 11. it did better
compared to the bfs which had to search 13. The heurstic was pretty simple so 
it's not a very accurate h(n). It could be less for dfs since ti might be lucky
and have the right set of moves and find a solution fast.

For the missionaries and cannibals it didn't really help either the nodes searched for
each bfs, dfs, and a* were just within 1 of each other.
The search space itself is quite small for both these problems so having the heurstics isn't much better than just randomly
going through moves and the heurstic defined could just be worse than the random move order choosen by us.

The manhattan distance heurstics was much better than the tiles out of place one
it was actually able to solve the 2nd scenario when the tiles out of place wasn't able to.
This seemed to have more of an effect since the search space was much larger, when I was testing
the dfs on the tiles problem, it wasn't able to find a solution for any random state, I had to set up
a specific start state in which the moves I had listed was able to solve it. 

Both of them were able to solve the first example with the same amount of nodes searched this is probably
because it was much closer to the solution so the search space would be less.
